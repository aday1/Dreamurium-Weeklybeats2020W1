# WeeklyBeats-Week1 - The Dreamurium

About 4 days of work (Maybe about 14hours?)
- First day - Leads, Sound Design
- Second Day - Bass
- Third Day - Drums
- Third (Forth!) Day - Re-arranging - 'fixing' mixing, obsessing.


VSTS used:
Lead - Obscurium by SugarBytes - Patch Modified 'Dreamurium'
Bass - IRIS - Patch 'Power Bass'
Drums - Reaktor
FX: (Covering mistakes) - Looperator by SugarBytes
DAW: Bitwig Studio 3.x - Some bit crushing and some compressors

GLSL Sandbox and some tweaks in ShaderLoader.dll (+ Resolume 5)

(Tried to include the sources to credit the original shader authors before I forked it)

My post publishing feels:
I feel like this turned out a rough around the edges 
So I think in future, I should be doing the visual programming side during the incubation process or the production....
(But i orginally had creaivity issues trying to visualize what this even looks like after the sound design process....)

so anyway,... so i'm considering this a practice session (as .. i guess most of my sessions will turn out being really!)
.. ok ok ok lets go ...
